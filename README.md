Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The The Gaming Room client was wanting to expand their game "Draw it or Lose it" game. They wanted it to be cross-platform as well as expand on the memory and server usage. They wanted to expand pass the android only version that was their current app. They wanted software to expand on the android version of the game and replicate it for the other OS. They had specific requirements when it came to game components such as team names and user names, as well as more than one user to a team.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

He expressed that I did have great recommendations as well as great reasoning behind the recommendations.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design documents was extremely helpful, as I am most times unsure of what to add and what to leave out so having that outlined was extremely helpful. With having this documentation the creating of the code was extremely easy as it was just putting into code what was on the paper.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One part I would revise would actually be the template document as I personally benefit from both the UML diagram and the use of Psuedocode as it is the plain writing of the code which is helpful for me to know how to type out the code correctly and in what order that I need to address everything. Also most importantly it allows me to know the priority of the code.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Exceeding the users wants and needs is critical to being a consultant/contractor as it is our job to translate for the user into code what they want. I saw that they wanted unique names for teams and users so implemented a way to check against the current history to make sure that there was no overlap and then made sure that if there was there was any duplication that it was stopped. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

For me it is easier to disect everything and break it down into its individual parts before trying to piece together the code. I would try to make sure that everything is planned out, either via UML Diagram or Psuedocode so that I can visualize it and then make sure that I can correct any errors and have a paper trail of everything that I have coded.
